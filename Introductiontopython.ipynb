        "Is a widely-used general-purpose, high-level programming language, designed by Guido van Rossum in 1991. Guido Van Rossum began doing its application based work in December of 1989 at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) which is situated in the Netherland. It was started firstly as a hobby project because he was looking for an interesting project to keep him occupied during Christmas. The programming language which Python is said to have succeeded is ABC Programming Language, which had interfacing with the Amoeba Operating System and had the feature of exception handling. He had already helped to create ABC earlier in his career and he had seen some issues with ABC but liked most of the features. The inspiration for the name came from BBC’s TV Show – ‘Monty Python’s Flying Circus, as he was a big fan of the TV show and also he wanted a short, unique and slightly mysterious name for his invention and hence he named it Python!. The language was finally released in 1991 and the main objective is to provide code readability and advanced developer productivity.\n",
